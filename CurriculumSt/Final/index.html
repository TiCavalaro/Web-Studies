                    Who am I?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Nice to meet you,
                    Take a look at my hobbies, and understand a little bit about me!
                    I was once a great <p2>saxophonist</p2>, I loved the instrument deeply, and I specialized in jazz, I took classes for 4 years and participated in a band. I also know how to play the <p2>piano</p2> in an average way, I took lessons during the same period as the sax.
                    I have a beautiful Betta fish called Dante, in a planted aquarium of approximately 40 liters, he is full of personality and very energetic! I plan to make changes to the aquarium and change the vibe a bit. Furthermore, <p2>I've been to several countries and I have advanced English</p2>, I haven't practiced in a few years, so it's a little rubbish.
                    I worked with <p2>crypto</p2> for years and got to employ a few people with great success, I stopped because of my college.
                </p>
                <h1>
                    What i know?
                </h1>
                <p id="mypara">
                    I'm currently studying at the <p2>Federal Institute of São Paulo</p2>, where I learned <p2>C++, Java, logic</p2> among many other things, my favorite subject was data structure, my highest grade in college! <p2>I have advanced English, I read and understand perfectly,
                     but I have difficulty with pronunciation and writing because I have no practice</p2>.
                    Not only that, but I'm studying C++ and Java outside college, in addition to <p2>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python</p2>.
                    I took a beginner and intermediate <p2>Linux, Web design and crypto</p2> courses.
                </p>
